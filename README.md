## Problem Statement

Liminal Works currently enlists the help of its volunteers to develop theories of change for grassroot activists and organizations. 
This task can be very time-consuming and subjective. Using AI to facilitate this process, the time spent developing theories
of change is significantly reduced, allowing for volunteers and employees to allocate their time to more important tasks.

## Introduction

Alpaca 3 is an AI model trained on data about theory of change (TOC), what makes a good TIC, and how to craft a TOC. Users are able to 
directly ask Alpaca 3 questions they have, or they can upload pdfs that the AI will scan and respond to. 



## How it works

The user writes text or uploads a pdf, and this input is then sent as a query to the API gpt that generates a response. 
The response is filtered through a database containing data about TOC. If the response relates to TOC, the AI response
is let through. If not, the AI responds with how the query is not relevant to TOC.
